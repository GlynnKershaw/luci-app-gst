Tool for managing connection to game servers.

There are several functions:
* Get info about the current game server
* Block the whole subnet of the current game server
* Get latency (assuming ICMP is allowed by server admin)
* Filter servers to a single country (currently just UK & US; only applies to Call of Duty)
* Block all servers (theoretically)
* Unblock all servers
* List blocked subnets

All code already written and functional. Publication is contingent on me finding a suitable license and setting up an efficient development enviroment (for writing setup scripts for other developers).
